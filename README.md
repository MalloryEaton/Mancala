2.	This application allows the user to enjoy the beauty of Kirby while 
	playing the game of Mancala which we all know and love. One can look
	at the About page, the Instructions page, or play the game from the
	main menu. When the user presses the play button, if there are any 
	previously loaded games it will load them. If suspended, it will save
	the state of the game board, but not if it is a game over. In the game
	play page one can naviagate to the instructions and home.
	
3.	Cannot click on the cup if mouse is on a marble (marbles are above button, and we can't figure out how to fix it)
4.	We did everything together, for the most part.
	Mallory: Animations, Game Over logic, did a lot of planning for the architecture of the game, researched other games
	Cat: Saving state, marble locations, cups logic, created images,
